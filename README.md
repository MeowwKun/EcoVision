EcoVision is an interactive recycling website integrated with a custom Arduino-based smart box. Users can scan plastic bottles, and the box will open to recycle the bottle. Points are awarded based on the type of bottle and whether it is crushed before recycling, encouraging sustainable behavior.

## Features

- Scan plastic bottles using the webcam integrated with the box
- Automatic opening of the box for recycling
- Points system for bottle type and crushed bottles
- Interactive and gamified recycling experience

## Hardware

- Arduino controlling the box motors
- Webcam for scanning bottles
- Cardboard box housing the system

## Software

- Web interface to interact with the EcoVision system
- Backend tracking points and bottle scans
- Integration with Arduino for controlling motors and sensors

## How It Works

1. Place a plastic bottle in front of the webcam.
2. The system scans and identifies the bottle.
3. The box opens automatically for recycling.
4. Users earn points based on the bottle type and if it is crushed.
